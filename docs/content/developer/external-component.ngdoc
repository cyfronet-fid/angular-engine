# External Components

External components are angular components which correspond to metrics defined in agreemount.engine

External component is a normal component from the standpoint of the application (it's declared
by standard `.component` method. Engine integration is done in `metrics.yml` file, where external
metric corresponding to declared component must be defined.

## Sample YAML file declaring extarnal component metric:

<pre>
   - !com.agreemount.bean.metric.ExternalMetric
     id: teamMembership
     label: Team membership
     categoryId: documentationSettings
     required: false
     position: 7
     description: add members of proposal
     externalType: sample-external-component  # this is tag which will be 
                                              # injected into final template,
                                              # it corresponds to external 
                                              # component named teamMembers
</pre>

From javascript / frontend standpoint component is just a normal component which must be registered in the
application. All data concering metric, form, and document are passed via bindings. Your custom component
can define only binding required by your comonent's functionality.

## Minimal external component declaration

<pre>
    angular.module('app').component('sampleExternalComponent', {
      templateUrl: 'sampleExternalComponent.template.html',
      controller: function () {
      
      },
      bindings: {
        ngModel: '=',
        options: '=',
        formlyOptions: '=',
        ngDisabled: '=',
        errors: '=',
        metric: '=',
        metricId: '@'
      }
    });
</pre>

## Bindings

There is a couple of objects which are passed to external component via bindings.
Here is a list with a description:

* **`ngModel`** - current document, you can access other metrics, as well as other document fields, such as author, name, creation date or state.
* **`options`** - current document options. It will be the same optionas as the ones specified while registering document in angular-engine (see 
  {@link engine.provider:$engineProvider#methods_document $engineProvider.document(...))})
* **`ngDisabled`** - true if current control should be disabled, false otherwise
* **`metricId`** - id of the external metric, can be used to insert values into `ngModel.metrics[metricId]`
* **`metric`** - Object containing all raw data of the metric, in the format received from agreemount.engine
* **`errors`** - Object containing errors for current control
* **`formlyOptions`** - Additional 'bag' property, it contains ALL data used to create this field in front end, use it with caution,
  as the stability of fields in this object is **not guaranteed** (may change between versions of angular-engine), if
  possible use other bindings to access necessary data.

## Events

Apart of bindings which can be accessed inside of component, it can also receive events dispatched from document.
Those events can be used to perform some additional work before actions are performed on the document.
Events which can be listened to are as follows:

* **`engine.common.action.before`** executed before any action is executed, context object contains: 
  ```
  {
    document: //document on which action is performed
    action:   //action object which is executed
    promises: //promises list which has to be fulfilled 
              //before action is executed, event handler can insert it's own
              //promise here, if it needs to perform async 
              //operation(s) before document is saved
  }   
  ```
  calling event.preventDefault() will cause an action to be prevented.
* **`engine.common.save.before`** executed before any save action (CREATE, UPDATE), apart of this works the same as `engine.common.action.before`
* **`engine.common.action.after`** executed after any action, context object contains 
  ```
  {
    document: //document on which action is performed
    action:   //action object which is executed
    result:   //result of the action, as passed by agreemount.engine
  }   
  ```
  calling event.preventDefault() has no effect here;
* `engine.common.save.after`** executed after any save action (CREATE, UPDATE), apart of this works the same as `engine.common.action.after`
* **`engine.common.action.error`** executed if error occurs during any action execution, context object is the same as `engine.common.action.after`
  calling event.preventDefault() has no effect here;
* **`engine.common.save.error`** executed if error occurs during any save action (CREATE, UPDATE) execution, context object is the same as `engine.common.action.after`
  calling event.preventDefault() has no effect here;
